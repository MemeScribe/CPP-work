# CPP-work
Since the university I study at doesn't teach C++, I've decided to teach myself alongside other programming languages such as Java and Python.
To do that, I've taken programming questions given to us and re-did them in a C++ enviroment.
My goal is to understand C++ well enough to possibly use it for any future projects later on in the course, and later on in the workforce.
